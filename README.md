# nano_compressor

  This is an open source file compressor that is in its initial stages.  I am currently working on finishing the image compression and decompression process, then I will start on the pdf compression.  I use a letter system for the compression symbols relating to the binary bits associated with a file, whether it's in octets or in hex.  The GUI that is used for this project is wxwidgets.
